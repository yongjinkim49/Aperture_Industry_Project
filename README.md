# Aperture Finance Industry Project
## Industry project with Aperture Finance: Portfolio Analytics

This is an industry project with [Deepak Singh](), done as part of UC Berkeley Master of Financial Engineering (MFE) program for field experience.

The project is with [Aperture Finance](https://aperture.finance/), a cross-chain DeFi investment strategy marketplace. One of its major investment strategies implements the delta-neutral strategy which allows the investor to yield-farm on synthetic tokens pegged to stocks with less exposure to value fluctuations. More on it can be found here: [Aperture Docs](https://docs.aperture.finance/docs/)

We pursue to create a portfolio analytics tool through which Aperture Finance and its investors can evaluate the assumed realized returns, Sharpe ratio, and rebalancing costs for each pool.

We start with querying data from the Terra blockchain upon which Aperture Finance operates. Data can be queried via REST API and we primarily rely on python as means of query and analysis. 

One would have to ```pip install requests``` first.
